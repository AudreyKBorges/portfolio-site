            <div class="home-paragraph">
            <p>I'm a recent Summa Cum Laude graduate of the Bachelor of Science program in Web Development and Design at Champlain College
                in Burlington, Vermont, and I am familiar with front-end and back-end web technologies. My current stack is pure
                HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I have also worked with WordPress, Figma, Python, MySQL, sass/scss, Bootstrap and had exposure to Invision,
                SQL, and the PHP framework, Symfony.</p>
            <p>Web development became my passion because I am fascinated by technology and I enjoy creative and analytical work.
                The first content management system I ever worked on was Joomla, which was used to manage my former company's website.
            I edited content, managed the blog, and wrote content for the blog as well. My natural curiosity drove me to learn how websites
        are built, so I started learning HTML and CSS then Python and my programming journey took off. I learn more every day, and I love it!</p>
            <p>Houston, Texas is currently my home base, and the weather is hot but so is the art
                scene. When I'm not building an awesome new web project or working at theCoderSchool teaching kids to code, 
            I go to art museums and art shows, enjoy coffee--love my cold brew with oat milk, and get my nature fix at
        one of Houston's many beautiful parks.</p>

            <p class="AL-paragraph">Audrey's List is a site made with love for families who have loved ones of all ages who have autism. Families looking for therapy,
                playgroups, activities, and parent support groups will find these resources on my site. New resources are being added for the Houston area, however
                I do plan to expand to include other cities around the United States.</p>
